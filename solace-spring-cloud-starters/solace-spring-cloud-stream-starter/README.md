## Overview

The Solace implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder maps the following concepts from Spring to Solace:

* Destinations to topic subscriptions (Source apps always send messages to a topic)
* Consumer groups to durable queues 
* Anonymous consumer groups to temporary queues (When no group is specified; used for SCS Publish-Subscribe Model) 

And internally, each consumer group queue is subscribed to at least their destination topic. So a typical message flow would then appear as follows:

1. Producer bindings publish messages to their destination topics
2. Consumer group queues receive the messages published to their destination topic
3. Consumers of a particular consumer group consume messages from their group in a round-robin fashion (by default)

Note that partitioning is not yet supported by this version of the binder.

Note that since the Binder always consumes from queues it is currently required that Assured Delivery be enabled on the Solace PubSub+ Message VPN being used (Assured Delivery is automatically enabled if using Solace Cloud.) 

Also, it will be assumed that you have a basic understanding of the Spring Cloud Stream project. If not, then please refer to [Spring's documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/). For the sake of brevity, this document will solely focus on discussing components unique to Solace.

## Spring Cloud Stream Binder

This project extends the Spring Cloud Stream Binder project. If you are new to Spring Cloud Stream, [check out their documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle).

The following is a brief excerpt from that document:

> Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications. Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers. It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.

## Using it in your Application

### Updating your build

The releases from this project are hosted in [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.solace.spring.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace).

The easiest way to get started is to include the `spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace` in your application.

Here is how to include the spring cloud stream starter in your project using Gradle and Maven.

#### Using it with Gradle

```groovy
// Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder
compile("com.solace.spring.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace:2.1.0")
```

#### Using it with Maven

```xml
<!-- Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.solace.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Creating a Simple Solace Binding

Starting in Spring Cloud Stream version 3 the recommended way to define binding and binding names is to use the Functional approach, which uses Spring Cloud Functions. You can learn more in the [Spring Cloud Function support](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring_cloud_function) and [Functional Binding Names](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_functional_binding_names) sections of the reference guide. 

Given this example app: 
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleAppApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SampleAppApplication.class, args);
	}
	
	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	    return value -> value.toUpperCase();
	}
}

```

An applicable Solace configuration file may look like:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    function:
      definition: uppercase
    stream:
      bindings:
        uppercase-in-0:
          destination: queuename
          group: myconsumergroup
          binder: solace-broker
        uppercase-out-0:
          destination: uppercase/topic
          binder: solace-broker
      binders:
        solace-broker:
          type: solace
          environment:
            solace:
              java:
                host: tcp://localhost:55555
                msgVpn: default
                clientUsername: default
                clientPassword: default
                connectRetries: -1
                reconnectRetries: -1
```

Notice that the latter half of this configuration actually originates from the [JCSMP Spring Boot Auto-Configuration project](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-java-spring-boot#updating-your-application-properties).

## Configuration Options

Configuration of the Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder is done through [Spring Boot's externalized configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html). This is where users can control the binder's configuration options as well as the Solace Java API properties.

### Inherited Configuration Options

As for auto-configuration-related options required for auto-connecting to Solace message brokers, refer to the [JCSMP Spring Boot Auto-Configuration documentation](https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-java-spring-boot#configure-the-application-to-use-your-solace-pubsub-service-credentials).

For general binder configuration options and properties, refer to the [Spring Cloud Stream Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_configuration_options).

### Solace Binder Configuration Options

## Consumer Concurrency

Configure Spring Cloud Stream's [concurrency consumer property](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_consumer_properties) to enable concurrent message consumption for a particular consumer binding.

Though note that there are few limitations:

1. `concurrency` > 1 is not supported for exclusive queues.
1. `concurrency` > 1 is not supported for consumer bindings which are a part of anonymous consumer groups.
1. `concurrency` > 1 is ignored for polled consumers.
1. Setting `provisionDurableQueue` to `false` disables endpoint configuration validation. Meaning that point 1 cannot validated. In this scenario, it is the developer's responsibility to ensure that `concurrency` is properly configured.

## Message Target Destination

Spring Cloud Stream has a reserved message header called `scst_targetDestination` (retrievable via `BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION`), which allows for messages to be redirected from their bindings' configured destination to the target destination specified by this header.

For this binder's implementation of this header, the target destination defines the *exact* Solace topic to which a message will be sent. i.e. No post-processing is done for this header (e.g. `prefix` is not applied).

If you want to apply a destination post-processing step – lets say `prefix` for example, you will need to directly apply that to the header itself:

```java
@Value("${spring.cloud.stream.solace.bindings.<bindingName>.producer.prefix}")
String prefix;

public Message<String> buildMeAMessage() {
    return MessageBuilder.withPayload("payload")
        .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, prefix + "new-target-destination")
        .build();
}
```

Also, this header is cleared by the message's producer before it is sent off to the message broker. So you should attach the target destination to your message payload if you want to get that information on the consumer-side.

## Failed Message Error Handling

The Spring cloud stream framework already provides a number of application-internal reprocessing strategies for failed messages during message consumption such as. You can read more about that [here](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/current/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling):

However, after all internal error handling strategies have been exhausted, the Solace implementation of the binder would by default reject messages that consumer bindings fail to process. Though it may be desirable for these failed messages be preserved and externally re-processed, in which case this binder also provides 2 error handling strategies that consumer bindings can be configured to use:

* Re-queuing the message onto that consumer group's queue
* Re-publishing the message to another queue (a dead-message queue) for some external application/binding to process

Note that both strategies cannot be used at the same time, and that enabling both of them would result in the binder treating it as if message re-queuing was disabled. That is to say, re-publishing failed messages to a dead-message queues supersedes message re-queuing.

### Message Re-Queuing

A simple error handling strategy in which failed messages are simply re-queued onto the consumer group's queue. This is very similar to simply enabling the retry template (setting maxAttempts to a value greater than 1), but allows for the failed messages to be re-processed by the message broker.

### Dead-Message Queue Processing

First, it must be noted that the dead message queue (DMQ) that will be discussed in this section is different from the regular [Solace DMQ](https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Setting-Dead-Msg-Queues.htm). In particular, the standard Solace DMQ is used for re-routing failed messages as a consequence of Solace PubSub+ messaging features such as TTL expiration or exceeding a message's max redelivery count. Whereas the purpose of a Solace binder DMQ is for re-routing messages which had been successfully consumed from the message broker, yet cannot be processed by the binder. For simplicity, in this document all mentions of the "DMQ" refers to the Solace binder DMQ.

A DMQ can be provisioned for a particular consumer group by setting the autoBindDmq consumer property to true. This DMQ is simply another durable queue which, aside from its purpose, is not much from the queue provisioned for consumer groups. These DMQs are named using a period-delimited concatenation of their consumer group name and "dmq". And like the queue used for consumer groups, their endpoint properties can be configured by means of any consumer properties whose names begin with "dmq".

Note that DMQs are not intended to be used with anonymous consumer groups. Since the names of these consumer groups, and in turn the name of their would-be DMQs, are randomly generated at runtime, it would provide little value to create bindings to these DMQs because of their unpredictable naming and temporary existence.
