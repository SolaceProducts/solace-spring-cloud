An implementation of Spring's Cloud Stream Binder for integrating with Solace PubSub+ message brokers. The Spring Cloud Stream Binder project provides a higher-level abstraction towards messaging that standardizes the development of distributed message-based systems.

== Overview

The Solace implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder maps the following concepts from Spring to Solace:

* Destinations to topics/subscriptions
** Producer bindings always sends messages to topics
* Consumer groups to durable queues
** A consumer group's queue is subscribed to its destination subscription (default)
** Consumer bindings always receives messages from queues
* Anonymous consumer groups to temporary queues (When no group is specified; used for SCS Publish-Subscribe Model)

In Solace, the above setup is called topic-to-queue mapping. So a typical message flow would then appear as follows:

. Producer bindings publish messages to their destination topics
. Each consumer groups' queue receives the messages published to their destination topic
. The PubSub+ broker distributes messages in a round-robin fashion to each consumer binding for a particular consumer group
+
NOTE: Round-robin distribution only occurs if the consumer group's queue is configured for non-exclusive access. If the queue has exclusive access, then only one consumer will receive messages.

NOTE: Partitioning is not yet supported by this version of the binder.

IMPORTANT: Since consumer bindings always consumes from queues it is required that Assured Delivery is enabled on the Solace PubSub+ Message VPN being used (Assured Delivery is automatically enabled if using Solace Cloud). Additionally, the client username's client profile must be allowed to send and receive guaranteed messages.

For the sake of brevity, it will be assumed that you have a basic understanding of the Spring Cloud Stream project. If not, then please refer to https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/[Spring's documentation]. This document will solely focus on discussing components unique to Solace.

== Spring Cloud Stream Binder

This project extends the Spring Cloud Stream Binder project. If you are new to Spring Cloud Stream, https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/[check out their documentation].

The following is a brief excerpt from that document:

[quote, 'https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring-cloud-stream-overview-introducing[Introducing Spring Cloud Stream â€“ Spring Cloud Stream Reference Documentation]']
____
Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications. Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers. It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.

== Using it in your Application

=== Updating your build

The releases from this project are hosted in https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.solace.spring.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace[Maven Central].

The easiest way to get started is to include the `spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace` in your application.

Here is how to include the spring cloud stream starter in your project using Gradle and Maven.

==== Using it with Gradle

[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
// Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder
compile("com.solace.spring.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace:{revnumber}")

----

==== Using it with Maven

[source,xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<!-- Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.solace.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace</artifactId>
  <version>{revnumber}</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Creating a Simple Solace Binding

Starting in Spring Cloud Stream version 3 the recommended way to define binding and binding names is to use the Functional approach, which uses Spring Cloud Functions. You can learn more in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring_cloud_function[Spring Cloud Function support] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_functional_binding_names[Functional Binding Names] sections of the reference guide.

Given this example app:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleAppApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SampleAppApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	    return value -> value.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----

An applicable Solace configuration file may look like:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    function:
      definition: uppercase
    stream:
      bindings:
        uppercase-in-0:
          destination: queuename
          group: myconsumergroup
          binder: solace-broker
        uppercase-out-0:
          destination: uppercase/topic
          binder: solace-broker
      binders:
        solace-broker:
          type: solace
          environment:
            solace: # <1>
              java:
                host: tcp://localhost:55555
                msgVpn: default
                clientUsername: default
                clientPassword: default
                connectRetries: -1
                reconnectRetries: -1
#                apiProperties:
#                  ssl_trust_store: <path_to_trust_store>
#                  ssl_trust_store_password: <trust_store_password>
#                  ssl_validate_certificate: true

<1> The latter half of this configuration where the Solace session is configured actually originates from the https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-spring-boot/tree/master/solace-spring-boot-starters/solace-java-spring-boot-starter#updating-your-application-properties[JCSMP Spring Boot Auto-Configuration project]. See <<Solace Session Properties>> for more info.

== Configuration Options

=== Solace Binder Configuration Options

Configuration of the Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder is done through https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html[Spring Boot's externalized configuration]. This is where users can control the binder's configuration options as well as the Solace Java API properties.

For general binder configuration options and properties, refer to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_configuration_options[Spring Cloud Stream Reference Documentation].

==== Solace Session Properties

The binder's Solace session is configurable using properties prefixed by `solace.java` or `spring.cloud.stream.binders.<binder-name>.environment.solace.java`.

IMPORTANT: This binder leverages the JCSMP Spring Boot Auto-Configuration project to configure its session. See the https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-spring-boot/tree/master/solace-spring-boot-starters/solace-java-spring-boot-starter#configure-the-application-to-use-your-solace-pubsub-service-credentials[JCSMP Spring Boot Auto-Configuration documentation] for more info on how to configure these properties.

See <<Creating a Simple Solace Binding>> for a simple example of how to configure a session for this binder.

[TIP]
====
Additional session properties not available under the usual `solace.java` prefix can be set using `solace.java.apiProperties.<property>`, where `<property>` is the name of a https://docs.solace.com/API-Developer-Online-Ref-Documentation/java/com/solacesystems/jcsmp/JCSMPProperties.html[JCSMPProperties constant] (e.g. `ssl_trust_store`).

See https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-spring-boot/tree/master/solace-spring-boot-starters/solace-java-spring-boot-starter#updating-your-application-properties[JCSMP Spring Boot Auto-Configuration documentation] for more info about `solace.java.apiProperties`.

=== Solace Message Headers

Solace-defined Spring headers to get/set Solace metadata from/to Spring `Message` headers.

WARNING: `solace_` is a header space reserved for Solace-defined headers. Creating new `solace_`-prefixed headers is not supported. Doing so may cause unexpected side-effects in future versions of this binder.

CAUTION: Refer to each header's documentation for their expected usage scenario. Using headers outside of their intended type and access-control is not supported.

[NOTE]
====
Header inheritance applies to Solace message headers in processor message handlers:

[quote, 'https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_mechanics[Mechanics, Spring Cloud Stream Reference Documentation]']
____
When the non-void handler method returns, if the return value is already a `Message`, that `Message` becomes the payload. However, when the return value is not a `Message`, the new `Message` is constructed with the return value as the payload while inheriting headers from the input `Message` minus the headers defined or filtered by `SpringIntegrationProperties.messageHandlerNotPropagatedHeaders`.
____

==== Solace Headers

These headers are to get/set Solace message properties.

TIP: Use link:../../solace-spring-cloud-stream-binder/solace-spring-cloud-stream-binder-core/src/main/java/com/solace/spring/cloud/stream/binder/messaging/SolaceHeaders.java[SolaceHeaders] instead of hardcoding the header names. This class also contains the same documentation that you see here.

== Native Payload Types

Below are the payload types natively supported by this binder (before/after https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#content-type-management[Content Type Negotiation]):

[cols="1m,1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Payload Type | PubSub+ Message Type | Notes

| byte[]
| Binary Message
| Basic PubSub+ payload type.

| String
| Text Message
| Basic PubSub+ payload type.

| SDTStream
| Stream Message
| Basic PubSub+ payload type.

| SDTMap
| Map Message
| Basic PubSub+ payload type.

| String
| XML-Content Message
| Basic PubSub+ payload type.

Only available for consumption.

| Serializable
| Bytes Message
| This is not a basic payload type supported by the PubSub+ broker, but is one defined and coordinated by this binder.

**Publishing:**

When a `Serializable` payload which doesn't satisfy any of the basic PubSub+ payload types is given to the binder to publish, the binder will serialize this payload to a `byte[]` and set the user property, `solace_scst_serializedPayload`, to `true`.

**Consuming:**

When the binder consumes a binary message which has the `solace_scst_serializedPayload` user property set to `true`, the binder will deserialize the binary attachment.
|===

[TIP]
====
Typically, the Spring Cloud Stream framework will convert a published payload into a `byte[]` before giving it to the binder. In which case, this binder will publish a binary message.

If this occurs, but you wish to publish other message types, then one option is to set `useNativeEncoding=true` on your producer (https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_producer_properties[but read the caveats carefully before enabling this feature]), and have your message handler return a payload of one of this binder's supported native payload types; e.g. return `Message<SDTStream>` to publish a stream message.

See https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#content-type-management[Content Type Negotiation] for more info on how Spring Cloud Streams converts payloads and other options to control message conversion.
====

=== Empty Payload VS Null Payload

Spring messages can't contain null payloads, however, message handlers can differentiate between null payloads and empty payloads by looking at the `solace_scst_nullPayload` header. The binder adds the `solace_scst_nullPayload` header when a Solace message with null payload is consumed from the wire. When that is the case, the binder sets the Spring message's payload to a null equivalent payload. Null equivalent payloads are one of the following: empty `byte[]`, empty `String`, empty `SDTMap`, or empty `SDTStream`.

NOTE: Applications can't differentiate between null payloads and empty payloads when consuming binary messages or XML-content messages from the wire. This is because Solace always converts empty payloads to null payloads when those message types are published.

== Generated Queue Name Syntax

By default, generated consumer group queue names have the following form:

----
<prefix>/<familiarity-modifier>/<group>/<destination-encoding>/<encoded-destination>
----
prefix::
A static prefix as indicated by the `queueNamePrefix` (deprecated) configuration option.

familiarity-modifier::
Indicates the durability of the consumer group (`wk` for well-known or `an` for anonymous). Can be enabled/disabled with the `useFamiliarityInQueueName` (deprecated) config option.

group::
The consumer `group` name. Can be enabled/disabled for consumers with the `useGroupNameInQueueName` (deprecated) consumer config option.

destination-encoding::
Indicates the encoding scheme used to encode the destination in the queue name (currently only `plain` is supported). Can be enabled/disabled with the `useDestinationEncodingInQueueName` (deprecated) config option.

encoded-destination::
The encoded `destination` as per `<destination-encoding>`.

The `queueNameExpression` property's default SpEL expression conforms to the above format, however, users can provide any valid SpEL expression in order to generate custom queue names. Valid expressions evaluate against the following context:
[cols="1m,1", options="header"]
|===
| Context Variable
| Description

| destination
| The bindingâ€™s destination name.

| group
| The bindingâ€™s consumer group name.

| isAnonymous
| Indicates whether the consumer is an anonymous consumer group

| properties.solace
| The configured Solace binding properties.

| properties.spring
| The configured Spring binding properties.
|===

=== Generated Error Queue Name Syntax

By default, generated error queue names have the following form:

----
<prefix>/error/<familiarity-modifier>/<group>/<destination-encoding>/<encoded-destination>
----

The definitions of each segment of the error queue matches that from <<Generated Queue Name Syntax>>, with the following exceptions:

group::
The consumer `group` name. Can be enabled/disabled with the `useGroupNameInErrorQueueName` (deprecated) consumer config option.

The `errorQueueNameExpression` property's default SpEL expression conforms to the above format. Users can provide any valid SpEL expression in order to generate custom error queue names using the same evaluation context as described in <<Generated Queue Name Syntax>>.

== Consumer Concurrency

Configure Spring Cloud Stream's https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_consumer_properties[concurrency consumer property] to enable concurrent message consumption for a particular consumer binding.

Though note that there are few limitations:

. `concurrency` &gt; 1 is not supported for exclusive queues.
. `concurrency` &gt; 1 is not supported for consumer bindings which are a part of anonymous consumer groups.
. `concurrency` &gt; 1 is ignored for polled consumers.
. Setting `provisionDurableQueue` to `false` disables endpoint configuration validation. Meaning that point 1 cannot be validated. In this scenario, it is the developer's responsibility to ensure that point 1 is followed.

== Batch Consumers

https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_batch_consumers[Batch consumers] can be enabled by setting `spring.cloud.stream.bindings.<binding-name>.consumer.batch-mode` to `true`. In which case, batched messages may be consumed as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
Consumer<Message<List<Payload>>> input() {
	return batchMsg -> { // <1>
		List<Payload> batchedPayloads = batchMsg.getPayload();
		List<Map<String, Object>> batchedHeaders = (List<Map<String, Object>>) batchMsg.getHeaders().get(SolaceBinderHeaders.BATCHED_HEADERS); // <2>

		for (int i = 0; i < batchedPayloads.size(); i++) {
			Payload payload = batchedPayloads.get(i);
			Map<String, Object> headers = batchedHeaders.get(i);
			// Process inidividual message payload and its headers
		}
	};
}
----
<1> A batch of messages is really just a single Spring `Message` whose payload is a list of individual message payloads.
<2> The `solace_scst_batchedHeaders` message header contains the consolidated list of message headers for each of the individual messages in the batch.

IMPORTANT: Message batches are non-transacted. A batch that this binder creates is fundamentally a collection of individual messages and must not be treated as a single consistent unit.

[TIP]
====
If the Spring Cloud Stream framework fails to convert the batch message, consider setting one of the following consumer config options:

* An explicit https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_common_binding_properties[`contentType`].
** e.g. `application/octet-stream` for `byte[]` messages.
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_consumer_properties[`useNativeDecoding=true`] if the message handler is just consuming raw payload types.
** e.g. if PubSub+ delivers a binary message and the consumer message handler accepts `Message<List<byte[]>>`.
** https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_consumer_properties[Read the caveats carefully before enabling this feature]

See https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#content-type-management[Content Type Negotiation] for more info on how Spring Cloud Streams converts payloads and other options to control message conversion.

See <<Native Payload Types>> for more info regarding this binder's natively supported payload types.
====

To create a batch of messages, the binder will consume messages from the PubSub+ broker until either a maximum batch size or timeout has been achieved. After which, the binder will compose the batch message and send it to the consumer handler for processing. Both these batching parameters can be configured using the `batchMaxSize` and `batchTimeout` consumer config options.

== Manual Message Acknowledgment

Message handlers can disable auto-acknowledgement and manually invoke the acknowledgement callback as follows:

[source,java]
----
public void consume(Message<?> message) {
    AcknowledgmentCallback acknowledgmentCallback = StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(message); // <1>
    acknowledgmentCallback.noAutoAck(); // <2>
    try {
        AckUtils.accept(acknowledgmentCallback); // <3>
    } catch (SolaceAcknowledgmentException e) {} // <4>
}
----
<1> Get the message's acknowledgement callback header
<2> Disable auto-acknowledgement
<3> Acknowledge the message with the `ACCEPT` status
<4> Handle any acknowledgment exceptions (mostly `SolaceStaleMessageException`)

Refer to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/acks/AckUtils.html[AckUtils documentation] and https://javadoc.io/doc/org.springframework.integration/spring-integration-core/latest/org/springframework/integration/acks/AcknowledgmentCallback.html[AcknowledgmentCallback documentation] for more info on these objects.

TIP: If manual acknowledgement is to be done outside of the message handler's thread, then make sure auto-acknowledgement is disabled within the message handler's thread and not an external one. Otherwise, the binder will auto-acknowledge the message when the message handler returns.

For each acknowledgement status, the binder will perform the following actions:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Status
| Action

| ACCEPT
| Acknowledge the message.

| REJECT
| If `autoBindErrorQueue` is `true`, then republish the message onto the error queue and `ACCEPT` it. Otherwise, if the consumer is in a defined consumer group, invoke `REQUEUE`. Otherwise, the consumer is in an anonymous group, and the message will be discarded.

Refer to <<Failed Consumer Message Error Handling>> for more info.

| REQUEUE
| If the consumer is in a defined consumer group, rebind the consumer flow. Otherwise, a `SolaceAcknowledgmentException` will be thrown.

Refer to <<Message Redelivery>> for more info.
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
Acknowledgements may throw `SolaceAcknowledgmentException` depending on the current state of the consumer. Particularly if doing asynchronous acknowledgements, your invocation to acknowledge a message should catch `SolaceAcknowledgmentException` and deal with it accordingly.

*Example:* +
(refer to <<Message Redelivery>> for background info)

A `SolaceAcknowledgmentException` with cause `SolaceStaleMessageException` may be thrown when trying to asynchronously `ACCEPT` a stale message after the timeout elapses for the `REQUEUE` of another message. Though for this particular example, since the message that failed to `ACCEPT` will be redelivered, this exception can be caught and ignored if you have no business logic to revert.
====

NOTE: Manual acknowledgements do not support any application-internal error handling strategies (i.e. retry template, error channel forwarding, etc). Also, throwing an exception in the message handler will always acknowledge the message in some way regardless if auto-acknowledgment is disabled.

[TIP]
====
If asynchronously acknowledging messages, then if these messages arenâ€™t acknowledged in a timely manner, it is likely for the message consumption rate to stall due to the consumer queueâ€™s configured "Maximum Delivered Unacknowledged Messages per Flow".

This property can be configured for dynamically created queues by using https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Configuring-Endpoint-Templates.htm#Configur[queue templates]. However note that as per https://docs.solace.com/PubSub-Basics/Endpoints.htm#Which[our documentation], anonymous consumer group queues (i.e. temporary queues) will not match a queue templateâ€™s name filter. Only the queue template defined in the client profileâ€™s "Copy Settings From Queue Template" setting will apply to those.
====

== Dynamic Producer Destinations

Spring Cloud Stream has a reserved message header called `scst_targetDestination` (retrievable via `BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION`), which allows for messages to be redirected from their bindings' configured destination to the target destination specified by this header.

For this binder's implementation of this header, the target destination defines the _exact_ Solace topic to which a message will be sent. i.e. No post-processing is done for this header.

[source,java]
----
public class MyMessageBuilder {
    public Message<String> buildMeAMessage() {
        return MessageBuilder.withPayload("payload")
            .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, "some-dynamic-destination") // <1>
            .build();
    }
}
----
<1> This message will be sent to the `some-dynamic-destination` topic, ignoring the producer's configured destination

NOTE: This header is cleared by the message's producer before it is sent off to the message broker. So you should attach the target destination to your message payload if you want to get that information on the consumer-side.

== Failed Consumer Message Error Handling

The Spring cloud stream framework already provides a number of application-internal reprocessing strategies for failed messages during message consumption such as. You can read more about that https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling[here]:

However, after all internal error handling strategies have been exhausted, the Solace implementation of the binder would either:

* Redeliver the failed message (default)
* Republish the message to another queue (an error queue) for an external application/binding to process

=== Message Redelivery

A simple error handling strategy in which failed messages are redelivered from the consumer group's queue. This is very similar to simply enabling the retry template (setting `maxAttempts` to a value greater than `1`), but allows for the failed messages to be re-processed by the message broker.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Solace API used in this binder implementation does not support individual message redelivery.

Here is what happens under the hood when this is triggered:

1. The Solace flow receiver is stopped.
2. Wait until all unacknowledged messages have been acknowledged with a maximum timeout of `flowPreRebindWaitTimeout`. If timed out, the remaining unacknowledged messages will be stale and redelivered from the broker.
3. Rebind the flow.

Meaning that if unacknowledged messages are not processed in a timely manner, this operation will stall and potentially cause unecessary message duplication.
====

=== Error Queue Republishing

First, it must be noted that an Error Queue is different from a https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Setting-Dead-Msg-Queues.htm[Dead Message Queue (DMQ)]. In particular, a DMQ is used to capture re-routed failed messages as a consequence of Solace PubSub+ messaging features such as TTL expiration or exceeding a message's max redelivery count. Whereas the purpose of an Error Queue is to capture re-routed messages which have been successfully consumed from the message broker, yet cannot be processed by the application.

An Error Queue can be provisioned for a particular consumer group by setting the `autoBindErrorQueue` consumer config option to `true`. This Error Queue is simply another durable queue which is named as per the <<Generated Error Queue Name Syntax>> section. And like the queues used for consumer groups, its endpoint properties can be configured by means of any consumer properties whose names begin with "errorQueue".

[NOTE]
====
Error Queues should not be used with anonymous consumer groups.

Since the names of anonymous consumer groups, and in turn the name of their would-be Error Queues, are randomly generated at runtime, it would provide little value to create bindings to these Error Queues because of their unpredictable naming and temporary existence. Also, your environment will be polluted with orphaned Error Queues whenever these consumers rebind.
====

== Consumer Bindings Pause/Resume

The Solace binder supports pausing and resuming consumer bindings. See link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#binding_visualization_control[Spring Cloud Stream documentation] to learn how to pause and resume consumer bindings.

NOTE: There is no guarantee that the effect of pausing a binding will be instantaneous: messages already in-flight or being processed by the binder may still be delivered after the call to pause returns.

== Failed Producer Message Error Handling

By default, asynchronous producer errors aren't handled by the framework. Producer error channels can be enabled using the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_producer_properties[`errorChannelEnabled` producer config option].

Beyond that, this binder also supports using a `Future` to wait for publish confirmations. See <<Publisher Confirms>> for more info.

== Publisher Confirmations

For each message you can create a new link:../../solace-spring-cloud-stream-binder/solace-spring-cloud-stream-binder-core/src/main/java/com/solace/spring/cloud/stream/binder/util/CorrelationData.java[`CorrelationData`] instance and set it as the value of your message's `SolaceBinderHeaders.CONFIRM_CORRELATION` header.

NOTE: `CorrelationData` can be extended to add more correlation info. The `SolaceBinderHeaders.CONFIRM_CORRELATION` header is not reflected in the actual message published to the broker.

Now using `CorrelationData.getFuture().get()`, you can wait for a publish acknowledgment from the broker. If the publish failed, then this future will throw an exception.

For example:
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private StreamBridge streamBridge;

public void send(String payload, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) {
    CorrelationData correlationData = new CorrelationData();
    Message<SensorReading> message = MessageBuilder.withPayload(payload)
            .setHeader(SolaceBinderHeaders.CONFIRM_CORRELATION, correlationData)
            .build();

    streamBridge.send("output-destination", message);

    try {
        correlationData.getFuture().get(timeout, unit);
        // Do success logic
    } catch (InterruptedException | ExecutionException | TimeoutException e) {
        // Do failure logic
    }
}
----
== Solace Binder Health Indicator
Solace binders can report health statuses via the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_health_indicator[Spring Boot Actuator health endpoint]. To enable this feature, add Spring Boot Actuator to the classpath. To manually disable this feature, set `management.health.binders.enabled=false`.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Health Status
| Description

| UP
| Status indicating that the binder is functioning as expected.

| RECONNECTING
| Status indicating that the binder is actively trying to reconnect to the message broker.

This is a custom health status. It isn't included in the health severity order list (`management.endpoint.health.status.order`) and returns the default HTTP status code of `200`. To customize these, see https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints.health.writing-custom-health-indicators[Writing Custom HealthIndicators].

| DOWN
| Status indicating that the binder has suffered an unexpected failure. For instance, the binder may have exhausted all reconnection attempts. User intervention is likely required.
