An implementation of Spring's Cloud Stream Binder for integrating with Solace PubSub+ message brokers. The Spring Cloud Stream Binder project provides a higher-level abstraction towards messaging that standardizes the development of distributed message-based systems.

== Overview

The Solace implementation of the Spring Cloud Stream Binder maps the following concepts from Spring to Solace:

* Destinations to topic subscriptions (Source apps always send messages to a topic)
* Consumer groups to durable queues
* Anonymous consumer groups to temporary queues (When no group is specified; used for SCS Publish-Subscribe Model)

And internally, each consumer group queue is subscribed to at least their destination topic. So a typical message flow would then appear as follows:

. Producer bindings publish messages to their destination topics
. Consumer group queues receive the messages published to their destination topic
. Consumers of a particular consumer group consume messages from their group in a round-robin fashion (by default)

Note that partitioning is not yet supported by this version of the binder.

Note that since the Binder always consumes from queues it is currently required that Assured Delivery be enabled on the Solace PubSub+ Message VPN being used (Assured Delivery is automatically enabled if using Solace Cloud.)

Also, it will be assumed that you have a basic understanding of the Spring Cloud Stream project. If not, then please refer to https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/[Spring's documentation]. For the sake of brevity, this document will solely focus on discussing components unique to Solace.

== Spring Cloud Stream Binder

This project extends the Spring Cloud Stream Binder project. If you are new to Spring Cloud Stream, https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/[check out their documentation].

The following is a brief excerpt from that document:

[quote, 'https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring-cloud-stream-overview-introducing[Introducing Spring Cloud Stream â€“ Spring Cloud Stream Reference Documentation]']
____
Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building message-driven microservice applications. Spring Cloud Stream builds upon Spring Boot to create standalone, production-grade Spring applications and uses Spring Integration to provide connectivity to message brokers. It provides opinionated configuration of middleware from several vendors, introducing the concepts of persistent publish-subscribe semantics, consumer groups, and partitions.

== Using it in your Application

=== Updating your build

The releases from this project are hosted in https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.solace.spring.cloud/spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace[Maven Central].

The easiest way to get started is to include the `spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace` in your application.

Here is how to include the spring cloud stream starter in your project using Gradle and Maven.

==== Using it with Gradle

[source,groovy,subs="attributes+"]
----
// Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder
compile("com.solace.spring.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace:{revnumber}")

----

==== Using it with Maven

[source,xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<!-- Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.solace.spring.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-stream-solace</artifactId>
  <version>{revnumber}</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Creating a Simple Solace Binding

Starting in Spring Cloud Stream version 3 the recommended way to define binding and binding names is to use the Functional approach, which uses Spring Cloud Functions. You can learn more in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring_cloud_function[Spring Cloud Function support] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_functional_binding_names[Functional Binding Names] sections of the reference guide.

Given this example app:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SampleAppApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SampleAppApplication.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public Function<String, String> uppercase() {
	    return value -> value.toUpperCase();
	}
}
----

An applicable Solace configuration file may look like:

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    function:
      definition: uppercase
    stream:
      bindings:
        uppercase-in-0:
          destination: queuename
          group: myconsumergroup
          binder: solace-broker
        uppercase-out-0:
          destination: uppercase/topic
          binder: solace-broker
      binders:
        solace-broker:
          type: solace
          environment:
            solace:
              java:
                host: tcp://localhost:55555
                msgVpn: default
                clientUsername: default
                clientPassword: default
                connectRetries: -1
                reconnectRetries: -1
----

Notice that the latter half of this configuration actually originates from the https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-java-spring-boot#updating-your-application-properties[JCSMP Spring Boot Auto-Configuration project].

== Configuration Options

=== Solace Binder Configuration Options

Configuration of the Solace Spring Cloud Stream Binder is done through https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html[Spring Boot's externalized configuration]. This is where users can control the binder's configuration options as well as the Solace Java API properties.

=== Inherited Configuration Options

As for auto-configuration-related options required for auto-connecting to Solace message brokers, refer to the https://github.com/SolaceProducts/solace-java-spring-boot#configure-the-application-to-use-your-solace-pubsub-service-credentials[JCSMP Spring Boot Auto-Configuration documentation].

For general binder configuration options and properties, refer to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_configuration_options[Spring Cloud Stream Reference Documentation].

=== Solace Message Headers

Solace-defined Spring headers to get/set Solace metadata from/to Spring `Message` headers.

WARNING: `solace_` is a header space reserved for Solace-defined headers. Creating new `solace_`-prefixed headers is not supported. Doing so may cause unexpected side-effects in future versions of this binder.

CAUTION: Refer to each header's documentation for their expected usage scenario. Using headers outside of their intended type and access-control is not supported.

[NOTE]
====
Header inheritance applies to Solace message headers in processor message handlers:

[quote, 'https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_mechanics[Mechanics, Spring Cloud Stream Reference Documentation]']
____
When the non-void handler method returns, if the return value is already a `Message`, that `Message` becomes the payload. However, when the return value is not a `Message`, the new `Message` is constructed with the return value as the payload while inheriting headers from the input `Message` minus the headers defined or filtered by `SpringIntegrationProperties.messageHandlerNotPropagatedHeaders`.
____

== Consumer Concurrency

Configure Spring Cloud Stream's https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#_consumer_properties[concurrency consumer property] to enable concurrent message consumption for a particular consumer binding.

Though note that there are few limitations:

. `concurrency` &gt; 1 is not supported for exclusive queues.
. `concurrency` &gt; 1 is not supported for consumer bindings which are a part of anonymous consumer groups.
. `concurrency` &gt; 1 is ignored for polled consumers.
. Setting `provisionDurableQueue` to `false` disables endpoint configuration validation. Meaning that point 1 cannot validated. In this scenario, it is the developer's responsibility to ensure that `concurrency` is properly configured.

== Manual Message Acknowledgment

Message handlers can disable auto-acknowledgement and manually invoke the acknowledgement callback as follows:

[source,java]
----
public void consume(Message<?> message) {
    AcknowledgmentCallback acknowledgmentCallback = StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(message); // <1>
    acknowledgmentCallback.noAutoAck(); // <2>
    AckUtils.accept(acknowledgmentCallback); // <3>
}
----
<1> Get the message's acknowledgement callback header
<2> Disable auto-acknowledgement
<3> Acknowledge the message with the `ACCEPT` status

Refer to the https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/acks/AckUtils.html[AckUtils documentation] and https://javadoc.io/doc/org.springframework.integration/spring-integration-core/latest/org/springframework/integration/acks/AcknowledgmentCallback.html[AcknowledgmentCallback documentation] for more info on these objects.

TIP: If manual acknowledgement is to be done outside of the message handler's thread, then make sure auto-acknowledgement is disabled within the message handler's thread and not an external one. Otherwise, the binder will auto-acknowledge the message when the message handler returns.

For each acknowledgement status, the binder will perform the following actions:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Status
| Action

| ACCEPT
| Acknowledge the message.

| REJECT
| If `autoBindErrorQueue` is `true`, then republish the message onto the error queue and `ACCEPT` it. Otherwise, if the consumer is in a defined consumer group, invoke `REQUEUE`. Otherwise, the consumer is in an anonymous group, and the message will be discarded.

Refer to <<Failed Message Error Handling>> for more info.

| REQUEUE
| If the consumer is in a defined consumer group, rebind the consumer flow. Otherwise, a `SolaceAcknowledgmentException` will be thrown.

Refer to <<Message Redelivery>> for more info.
|===


NOTE: Manual acknowledgements do not support any application-internal error handling strategies (i.e. retry template, error channel forwarding, etc). Also, throwing an exception in the message handler will always acknowledge the message in some way regardless if auto-acknowledgment is disabled.

[TIP]
====
If asynchronously acknowledging messages, then if these messages arenâ€™t acknowledged in a timely manner, it is likely for the message consumption rate to stall due to the consumer queueâ€™s configured "Maximum Delivered Unacknowledged Messages per Flow".

This property can be configured for dynamically created queues by using https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Configuring-Endpoint-Templates.htm#Configur[queue templates]. However note that as per https://docs.solace.com/PubSub-Basics/Endpoints.htm#Which[our documentation], anonymous consumer group queues (i.e. temporary queues) will not match a queue templateâ€™s name filter. Only the queue template defined in the client profileâ€™s "Copy Settings From Queue Template" setting will apply to those.
====

== Message Target Destination

Spring Cloud Stream has a reserved message header called `scst_targetDestination` (retrievable via `BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION`), which allows for messages to be redirected from their bindings' configured destination to the target destination specified by this header.

For this binder's implementation of this header, the target destination defines the _exact_ Solace topic to which a message will be sent. i.e. No post-processing is done for this header (e.g. `prefix` is not applied).

If you want to apply a destination post-processing step â€“ lets say the `prefix` for example, you will need to directly apply that to the header itself:

[source,java]
----
public class MyMessageBuilder {
    @Value("${spring.cloud.stream.solace.bindings.<bindingName>.producer.prefix}") // <1>
    String prefix;

    public Message<String> buildMeAMessage() {
        return MessageBuilder.withPayload("payload")
            .setHeader(BinderHeaders.TARGET_DESTINATION, prefix + "new-target-destination") // <2>
            .build();
    }
}
----
<1> Retrieve your binding's configured prefix.
<2> Apply the prefix to the target destination header.

Also, this header is cleared by the message's producer before it is sent off to the message broker. So you should attach the target destination to your message payload if you want to get that information on the consumer-side.

== Failed Message Error Handling

The Spring cloud stream framework already provides a number of application-internal reprocessing strategies for failed messages during message consumption such as. You can read more about that https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/{scst-version}/reference/html/spring-cloud-stream.html#spring-cloud-stream-overview-error-handling[here]:

However, after all internal error handling strategies have been exhausted, the Solace implementation of the binder would either:

* Redeliver the failed message (default)
* Republish the message to another queue (an error queue) for an external application/binding to process

=== Message Redelivery

A simple error handling strategy in which failed messages are redelivered from the consumer group's queue. This is very similar to simply enabling the retry template (setting `maxAttempts` to a value greater than `1`), but allows for the failed messages to be re-processed by the message broker.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Solace API used in this binder implementation does not support individual message redelivery.

Here is what happens under the hood when this is triggered:

1. The Solace flow receiver is stopped.
2. Wait until all unacknowledged messages have been acknowledged.
3. Rebind the flow.

Meaning if unacknowledged messages are not processed in a timely manner, this operation will stall.
====

=== Error Queue Republishing

First, it must be noted that an Error Queue is different from a https://docs.solace.com/Configuring-and-Managing/Setting-Dead-Msg-Queues.htm[Dead Message Queue (DMQ)]. In particular, a DMQ is used to capture re-routed failed messages as a consequence of Solace PubSub+ messaging features such as TTL expiration or exceeding a message's max redelivery count. Whereas the purpose of an Error Queue is to capture re-routed messages which have been successfully consumed from the message broker, yet cannot be processed by the application.

An Error Queue can be provisioned for a particular consumer group by setting the `autoBindErrorQueue` consumer config option to `true`. This Error Queue is simply another durable queue which is named using a period-delimited concatenation of their consumer group name and `error`. And like the queues used for consumer groups, its endpoint properties can be configured by means of any consumer properties whose names begin with "errorQueue".

[NOTE]
====
Error Queues should not be used with anonymous consumer groups.

Since the names of anonymous consumer groups, and in turn the name of their would-be Error Queues, are randomly generated at runtime, it would provide little value to create bindings to these Error Queues because of their unpredictable naming and temporary existence. Also, your environment will be polluted with orphaned Error Queues whenever these consumers rebind.
