             ### Context
             [Failed Run](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
             Workflow name = `${{ github.workflow }}`
             Job -           `${{ github.job }}`
             ### Error Info
             See Failed Run link above for more info, but the likley culprit is a new version of Spring Boot has been released and we need to open an issue over at [start.spring.io](https://github.com/spring-io/start.spring.io/issues) to have them re-enable Solace.
